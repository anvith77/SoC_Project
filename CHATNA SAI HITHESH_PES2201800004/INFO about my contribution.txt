By Using Xilinx Vivado HLS 2015.2 , I done basic matrix multiplication code  and I tested it whether I get desired results or not. The synthesis and simulation 
performed by using Artix -7 board.
And I check whether the synthesis are matched or not 
The results are mentioned in following files
And this is not the final project and we both combine our ideas and we put togther and made final project and this is just my contribution
